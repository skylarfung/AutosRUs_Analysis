## MPG Regression 

The linear model shows that the variables that have the most effect on the mileage are the vehicle length and the ground clearance. The other values, although they help the R squared value, do not have a significant impact in the regression. The p-value, which is 3.637e-12, is significantly smaller than the assumed significant level of 0.05%. Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis and say that the slope of the liner model is not zero. The best linear model with the least amount of overfitting has an r-squared value of 0.674. The model is not very effective in predicting the MPG and will need more variables to predict the MPG more accurately.

## Suspension Coil Summary 

The summary statistic for the different manufacturing lots producing the suspension coils show that there is potentially a difference in the means between the three lots. The mean PSI for coil manufactured in lot 3 are lower than the other two lots. This can be further examined in the next section where we test the difference between the two means. However, the current design does not meet the specification that the variance does not exceed 100 PSI. The variance in coils produced in lot 3 is a lot higher than the other two and exceeds 100 PSI.

## Suspension Coil T-Test

A one-way ANOVA test was run to see if all the means are equal or if they were statistically different. The null hypothesis states that the means of the PSI is all the same for coils produced at the three lots. The alternative hypothesis stats that the means between the three lots are not equal. The significance level is assumed to be 0.05. After running the test, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. The p-value is 0.014 which is under the 0.05 significance level set in the beginning. Therefore, we can assume that the mean of the population is equal to 1500. 

## Designed Study

To compare the performance of Mecha Cars to other vehicles, specific variables should be researched and found. The specific variables needed for this test are customer ratings for both Mecha Cars and competitor vehicles along with the metrics for the car like cost, fuel efficiency, horsepower, car class, and a comfort metric.  The first question to ask is what feature matter to consumers and how do these features effect the rating of a car. You can run a multiple linear regression to find out which features matter the most to consumers and see how exactly they change the overall rating of the car. After the regression is made, we can then test each metric individually to see if there is a statistical difference between Mecha Cars and the general population. This will show which areas Mecha Cars excels at and which areas of manufacturing need improvement.
